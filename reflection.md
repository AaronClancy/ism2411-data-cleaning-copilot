# What Copilot Generated
Copilot generated the ```handle_missing_values(df)``` function and the ```remove_invalid_rows(df)``` function.
I simply told it to generate me functions that completed the task that I needed it to. After a bit of tweaking,
it was just as I wanted it to be.

# What I Modified
Copilot did get a few things wrong here and there, which was expected. It got the names of the columns incorrect.
For example, it would type ```df["quantity"]``` when the actual name of the quantity column is ```"qty"```.
It did the same thing for ```"Price"``` as it capitalized the P, even after I wrote the code earlier that forced
the column names to be fully lowercase.

# What I Learned
I learned that the Github workflow is a lot daunting than it comes off as. It is very invisible, and does not really
require a lot of extra work. Having Github commits and publishing seems very helpful in the real world, and I definitely
see myself using Git and Github more often for future projects, especially if I persue a career in the field.
